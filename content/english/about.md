      content : In a team of 3 people working on automating the generation of forex reports for Standard Bank Risk teams internal used. The initial report were done using a specialized licenced software that was expensive long term. The aim was to build in in-house version of that report generation. I was responsible to write the main backend codebase to hold all the logic. That would involve building the structure of the backend server and writing the different API endpoints for each use case. This Docker-based API project is in production and performs similar to the initial software bought for the purpose.

Hey guys Julien here! Machine Learning Engineer. I love everything Data Science, and Software Engineering related works. 
In Software Engineering, I do mostly back-end work jobs. In Machine Learning, I build models, test them and make them production ready.
My passion is to see my code running to solve a real world problem. 

I am also a Machine Learning researcher. Besides using libraries like TF, Scikit-Learn and the others, I also have a duty of improving and discovering new learning structures.
