Hey guys Julien here! Machine Learning Engineer. I love everything Data Science, and Software Engineering related works. 
In Software Engineering, I do mostly back-end work jobs. In Machine Learning, I build models, test them and make them production ready.
My passion is to see my code running to solve a real world problem. 

I am also a Machine Learning researcher. Besides using libraries like TF, Scikit-Learn and the others, I also have a duty of improving and discovering new learning structures.
